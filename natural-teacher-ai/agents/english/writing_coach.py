        2. Identify 2-3 areas for improvement, explaining why they matter
        3. For each area, provide a concrete suggestion with an example of how to improve
        4. Ask a thought-provoking question about their writing to encourage reflection
        5. End with encouragement and next steps
        
        Write as if speaking directly to the student in a supportive, conversational tone.
